3d city builder [LAUNCH](http://lo-th.github.io/3d.city/index.html)<br>

Start with the exelent port of Micropolis by [graememcc](https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS) <br>
I remove all thirdparty library and optimize, compact the code.

you can try [2d version](http://lo-th.github.io/3d.city/index_2d.html) (some options not complete)

The goal is create full 3d city builder with game simulation in a worker,<br>
with massive use of [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [Sea3d](https://github.com/sunag/sea3d).

Work in progress
